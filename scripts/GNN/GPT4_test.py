    When one EDU is removed, you must generate a new EDU that replaces the removed one. The new EDU must be a strict 
    paraphrase of the removed EDU, without referencing, modifying, or inferring any details from the other EDUs. The
    relationships between EDUs will remain implicitly preserved without needing to be explicitly mentioned in the generated EDU.

    ### Rules:
    1. Each EDU represents a single, coherent idea.
    2. Relationships between EDUs are defined in the format: [EDU1] -> [EDU2]: <Relation>.
    3. When an EDU is removed:
      - Generate a new EDU that is strictly a paraphrase of the removed EDU. 
        The new EDU must only contain information present in the removed EDU 
        and must not introduce, modify, or infer any details from other EDUs 
        in the graph. Do not include any content from EDUs before or after it.
      - Ensure the generated EDU fits naturally with all connected EDUs.
      - Preserve all semantic relationships involving the missing EDU.

    {relationships_prompt}

    ### Example:
    Input EDUs:
    EDU1: 'how is the sky?'
    EDU2: 'The sky is overcast.'
    EDU3: 'It might rain later.'

    Relationships:
    [EDU1] -> [EDU2]: Question_answer_pair
    [EDU2] -> [EDU3]: Comment.

    The removed EDU is the EDU that appears in all relations specified in relationships

    EDU2 is removed. Generate a new EDU that logically replaces only EDU2, preserving all semantic
    relationships of EDU2 with other EDUs, defined in the previous list Relationships: 
    'The weather looks gloomy, which might indicate rain.'

    ---

    Now, process the following graph:

    Input EDUs:
    {subgraph_edus_text}

    Relationships:
    {subgraph_relationships_text}

    EDU{remapped_missing_edu+1} is removed.
    Generate a new EDU that logically replaces only EDU{remapped_missing_edu+1}, preserving all semantic
    relationships of EDU{remapped_missing_edu+1} with other EDUs, defined in the previous list Relationships:
